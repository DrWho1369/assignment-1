# Assignment 1 - Horiseon Website HTML and CSS Code Clean-up (Accessbility)

## The Repository 

This repository ("Assignment-1") is where I have saved my projects for EdX Front End Developer bootcamps first assignment. I have published an update to the Horiseon website HTML and CSS code. The focus of this project is too increase the accessibility of the HTML code by adding semantic HTML tags, alt text to images, and ensuring the code followed a logical flow. I also cleaned up the CSS file to reduce repeated code, and added comments for readability.

The repository contains a index.HTML file which has the main text and structure of the code. Within the Asset folder, the style.css file contains the CSS code which styles this HTML code. There is also an image folder to contain the images required to run this code correctly.
